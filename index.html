<h2>My top 5 movies of all time and one reason why</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Belly</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite films due to the dark lighting and visuals throughout the entire film. There are notable characters such as DMX, Nas, Method Man, T-Boz and many more. This movie was a fictional adapatation of a very common inner city storyline that feature a lot of major Rap and R&B musicians in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>This film highlights a very deep tale from the view point of Bruce Wayne as he makes his return to Gotham in order to save them in their final hour of need. The acting is exceptional led by Christian Bale and co-starring Tom Hardy as well as Gary Oldman. There are so many quotable references from this film that it is an instant classic for me.</p>
<h3>Gone in 60 Seconds</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my favorties due to all of the beautiful cars featured. From the 2002 Mercedes SL600, to the 1967 Shelby GT affectionaly nicknamed Eleanor. The movie basically proves that a love for a brother and family can bring a group of different people together from different backgrounds can accomplish any feat. Even if it means stealing 100 cars in one night.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This film is a favorite of mine because it challenges you to really question reality. Are we living in state of deep consciousness or are we dreaming within a dream? Plus, it is another Christoper Nolan masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Snatch</h3>
<p>This is a very funny movie that I have watched more than 100 times. An english action comedy starring many different great actors that are very purposeful in their acting. </p>
